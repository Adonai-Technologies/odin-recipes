      Beef Fried Rice is one of my favorite meals. It’s an easy way to use up
      leftover rice and veggies that you have in the fridge. Best of all this
      Beef Fried Rice Recipe can be made in under 30 minutes! I loaded this
      fried rice with carrots, broccoli, and lots of garlic. Everything gets
      sautéed in a large skillet along with the beef and rice. Once everything
      is cooked I add in my sauce: soy sauce, sesame oil and oyster sauce. Just
      3 ingredients! Here’s what you’ll need to make this beef fried rice:

      <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol>
       <p> <li>
          Heat 1 tablespoon of oil into a large skillet. Add the eggs and
          scramble until fully cooked. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
        </li></p>
        
        <p><li>
          Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add the steak and cook
          over high heat for 2-3 minutes, just until seared and caramelized on
          the outside. Remove from the pan and set aside.
        </li></p>
        
        <p><li>
          Add carrots and broccoli to the pan and cook until tender, 3-4
          minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for an additional minute.
        </li></p>
        
        <p><li>
          Add in the cold rice and sauté for 3-4 minutes. The rice should brown
          up a bit.
        </li></p>
        
        <p><li>
          Add the eggs and the steak back to the pan and stir in soy sauce,
          oyster sauce and sesame oil. Cook for 1-2 minutes to heat through.
        </li></p>
        
        <p></p><li>Serve immediately with sesame seeds for garnish, if desired.</li></p>
        
       <p> <li>
          Use long grain rice or jasmine rice: I prefer using either long grain
          rice or jasmine rice when making egg fried rice. They tend to hold up
          better than any other rice and tend not to get too sticky.
        </li></p>
        
      <p> <li>
          Day old rice is best: The trick to The Best Fried Rice is using cold
          day old rice. It doesn’t clump up and stick together like freshly
          cooked rice does. However if you are in a pinch make the rice first
          and spread it out onto a baking sheet in a single layer. Pop it in the
          fridge or freezer to cool down quickly.
